In this last chapter, we'll go over some tips on how to better use Fen. There's also a reference for all the Add-ons and sources used at the bottom of the page to be easier to find for more advanced users.

## Tips

### Item Options and Browse

You can access an item's options by long pressing on the item and selecting `FEN: Options...`. In this long press menu, you can also do some quick actions like marking the item as watched or refresh widgets.

Here you can access all of a show's seasons by going to `BROWSE` or navigate through a season's episodes by going to `BROWSE SEASON`.

### Selecting sources

After the add-on scrapes all the available sources you are thrown into a selection screen.

There are several reasons to prefer different sources:

- If a source is stuttering or buffering during play select a source of a smaller `SIZE`.

- If a source doesn't have embedded subtitles you can try a different source that might have some. You can also try different sources to sync up to subtitles downloaded from `a4kSubtitles`.

- If you want to watch shows in their original language try to avoid sources that contain `MULTI` or a specific language like `ITA` or `RUS` in their names. These sources are usually dubbed, although you can always listen to the original audio by toggling the audio track.

### Adding sources

If an item doesn't have a source or the ones that exist are not good you can add new sources to your Real-debrid cloud. By long pressing on the item go to `FEN: Options...` and select `DISPLAY UNCACHED TORRENTS`.

Now you can force a re-scrape by going to `FEN: Options...` → `PLAYBACK OPTIONS` → `RESCRAPE & SELECT SOURCE` and afterwards uncached torrents will appear on the list.
To add one to Real-debrid simply press on and select `OK` in the modal.

If the file has seeders it will be downloaded to your cloud and after a while (you can check the progress by going to [real-debrid.com/torrents](https://real-debrid.com/torrents)) you can re-scrape and start watching it.
