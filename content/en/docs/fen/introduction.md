Fen is a Kodi add-on that allows you to easily watch movies and shows with a streaming service like experience.

This guide will show you how to setup something like the video below:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jNapyuhpOA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;aspect-ratio:16/9;"></iframe>

## How it works

Before we start the guide let's take a look at how this solution works and the services you'll need to configure. For the full setup to work it requires 3 services:

### Kodi

Kodi is an open-source media player application available on multiple devices. We'll use it as the player where we stream the video content from. You'll need to install Kodi on the device you're setting up.

### Real-Debrid

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="A premium Real-Debrid account is required for this guide." />}}

Real-Debrid is an unrestricted downloader, a service that caches files on the internet and charges for fast access to them. They act as the source in this setup and it's in their servers where the files being streamed are stored.

To use the service you must first register an account and then purchase a premium package. The most cost-effective option is the 16â‚¬ 180 days package, which averages a price of **2,66â‚¬ a month**.

### Trakt

Trakt is a free service that keeps track (get it?) of what movies and shows you watch. It's through Trakt that the add-on knows what shows and movies you are currently watching, what episodes to watch next and even movies from custom lists.

## FAQ

### Why pay for piracy?

You're not paying for piracy, but for convenience. You're paying someone to handle all of the downloading and hosting sides of piracy and provide you with a high-quality and reliable video stream you can watch on the demand.

This way you can have the flexibility of piracy, all the content you will ever want to watch, with the convenience of a streaming service, where you simply select and consume. No more download times or fiddling with torrents and links.

### What shows are available?

If it's somewhere on the internet it can be available since Real-debrid caches its files from torrents. Any user can request to cache a torrent to the service and after it's downloaded those files will be available to every real-debrid user.

This means more popular shows will have more sources available but if you want to watch something that doesn't have a source you can be the one to request the download.

### Is this legal?

I'm not sure it's entirely legal, it also depends where you are in the world, but if you're worried or live in a country where they monitor your internet, use a VPN service and you'll be fine. Remember, you don't store any of the actual illegal files in your system, you're just streaming them from the internet.
