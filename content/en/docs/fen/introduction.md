Fen is a Kodi add-on that allows you to easily watch movies and shows with a streaming service like experience.

This guide will show you how to setup something like the video below:

## How it works

Before diving into guide let's first take a look at how this setup works and the services you'll need to configure it. These are the services and software we'll be using:

### Kodi

Kodi is an open-source media player application available for multiple devices. We'll use it in this setup to play the video content being streamed. You'll need to install Kodi on the device you're setting up.

### Real-Debrid

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="A premium Real-Debrid account is required for this guide." />}}

Real-Debrid is an unrestricted downloader service, they caches files found on the internet and charges for fast access to them. They act as the source in this setup and it's in their servers where the files being streamed are stored.

To use the service you must first register an account and then purchase a premium package. The most cost-effective option is the 16â‚¬ for 180 days package, which averages to a price of **2,66â‚¬ a month**.

### Trakt

Trakt is a free service that keeps track (get it?) of what movies and shows you watch. It's through Trakt that we will keep a list of shows and movies you are currently watching, what episodes you want to watch next and where you can build custom watchlists to pull movies from.

## FAQ

### Why pay for piracy?

You're not paying for piracy, but for convenience. You're paying someone to handle all of the downloading and hosting sides of piracy and provide you with a high-quality and reliable video stream you can watch on demand.

This way you can have the flexibility of piracy, all the content you will ever want to watch, with the convenience of a streaming service, where you simply select and consume. No more download times or fiddling with torrents or download links.

### What shows are available?

If it's somewhere on the internet it can be available since Real-debrid caches its files from torrents. Any user can request to cache a torrent to the service and after it has finished downloading those files are available to all real-debrid users that require them.

This means more popular shows will have more sources available but if you want to watch something that currently doesn't have a source you can be the one to request the download.

### Is this legal?

I'm not sure it's entirely legal, it also depends where you are in the world, but if you're worried or live in a country where your internet activity is monitored, you can use a VPN service and you will probably be fine. Remember, you don't store any of the actual illegal files in your system, you're just streaming them from the internet.
