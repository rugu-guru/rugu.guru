Seren is a Kodi add-on that allows you to easily watch movies and shows with a streaming service like experience.

This guide will show you how to setup something like the video bellow:

## Prerequisites

In order to start the installation process there are some services and accounts you need to configure.

### Kodi

Kodi is an open source media player application available on multiple devices. It is Kodi that we'll modify to stream movies and shows. You'll need to install Kodi on the device you wish to setup.

In Android systems you can download it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kodi&hl=en&gl=US).

[For other devices visit kodi.tv/download â†’](https://kodi.tv/download/)

### Real-Debrid

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="A premium Real-Debrid account is required for this tutorial." />}}

Real-Debrid is an unrestricted downloader that allows you to quickly download files hosted on the Internet, this is the service we will use to stream the video content from.

For the plugin to work you will need to register and purchase a **premium account**.

[You can find the sign-up page at real-debrid.com â†’](https://real-debrid.com/)

### Trakt

Trakt is a platform that keeps track (get it?) of what shows and movies you watched. Seren will use a Trakt account to know what episodes to play next and remember the shows you are watching.
