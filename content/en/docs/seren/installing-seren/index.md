After you have installed Kodi, and registered a [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) and [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/auth/join) account we can start the installation process.

## Navigating in Kodi

After opening Kodi for the first time this should be the screen you're greeted to.

Kodi's navigation centers around four navigation keys, an **Enter** button and a **Back** button.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ–¥" text="On a computer these keys are the navigation arrows, Enter and Backspace." />}}

Navigate to the settings page via the gear button (âš™) on the start screen to begin the installation process.

## Adding a repository

Seren is a custom plugin that expands Kodi's abilities. To install custom plugins we need to specify where they're information is fetched from. To do this in Kodi we need to add a repository.

To install a repository we first start by going to the `File manager` section in settings and selecting `Add source`.

![File manager screen](file-manager-add-source.png)

In the `Add file source` modal that appears below navigate to highlight the option `<None>`.

After selecting this option you'll see a textbox to input the source path. Here write the following url:

```
https://nixgates.github.io/packages/
```

After confirming, give the repository a name and press `OK`. We recommend you name it `Nixgates` as we will be referring to this name later in the guide.

Press `OK` and you will now see a `Nixgates` source in the `File manager` menu. This means the source has been added successfully.

Now we'll install the repository from this source, go back to the main settings page and navigating to `Add-ons`.

Here select `Install from zip file`.

#### Enabling unknown sources

If this is the first addon you try to install you might see a security popup that warns you that `add-ons from unknown sources are disabled`.

To enable unknown sources simply select `Settings` and toggle the `Unknown sources` option it the system settings. This will prompt a warning you can accept.

With unknown sources active you can go back and proceed with the installation process with `Install from zip file`.

Here you'll see a list of all the available sources in your device. One of them will be the `Nixgates` source we added in the previous step.

![Install from zip sources](install-from-zip-sources.png)

Select it and install the `repository.nixgates-2.*.*.zip` file found inside. After the repository is installed you will see an alert confirming the installation.

## Installing an addon

Now that the repository is installed we can finally install Seren. To do this, back in the `Addons` settings page select `Install from repository` and find the `Nixgates Repo`.

Inside navigate to `Video add-ons` and find `Seren`.

After selecting `Seren` you'll see the add-on details page where you can find a button to `Install`. Confirm any additional popups and wait for Seren to install.

You'll see a confirmation when it finishes installing.
